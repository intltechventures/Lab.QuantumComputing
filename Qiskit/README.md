    * "Qiskit is an open-source framework for quantum computing. It provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and running them on prototype quantum devices on IBM Q Experience or on simulators on a local computer. It follows the circuit model for universal quantum computation, and can be used for any quantum hardware (currently supports superconducting qubits and trapped ions[4]) that follows this model."
    * "Qiskit was founded by IBM Research to allow software development for their cloud quantum computing service, IBM Q Experience."
    * "The primary version of Qiskit uses the Python programming language."
    * "Qiskit Terra provides tools to create quantum circuits at or close to the
    level of quantum machine code."
    * "Qiskit Aqua provides tools that can be used without any explicit quantum
    programming required by the user themselves."
    * "n the near-term, development of quantum software will depend largely on
    simulation of small quantum devices. For Qiskit, this is provided by the Aer
    component. This provides simulators hosted locally on the user's device, as 
    well as HPC resources available through the cloud. he simulators can also simulate the effects of noise for simple and sophisticated noise models."
    * "Ignis is a component that contains tools for characterizing noise in
    near-term devices, as well as allowing computations to be performed in the
    presence of noise."

    * "The IBM Quantum Experience (previously known as the IBM Q Experience) is an
    online platform that gives users in the general public access to a set of
    IBM's prototype quantum processors via the Cloud, an online internet forum
    for discussing quantum computing relevant topics, a set of tutorials on how
      to program the IBM Q devices, and other educational material about quantum
      computing. It is an example of cloud-based quantum computing. As of May
      2018, there are three processors on the IBM Quantum Experience: two
      5-qubit processors and a 16-qubit processor. This service can be used to
      run algorithms and experiments, and explore tutorials and simulations
      around what might be possible with quantum computing. The site also
      provides an easily discoverable list of research papers published using
      the IBM Quantum Experience as an experimentation platform. "
